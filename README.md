# Data Visualization

My visualization of my keystrokes of two weeks in October 2016.

Uses D3 and the web audio api for the visualizations. Uses ES6 classes and RequireJS for easier code management.

## Installation
Clone this repo. It's all static HTML / CSS / JS so no further build step required.

## Usage
Run this app with a http-server for RequireJS and D3 to be able to import files. I recommend using something like [`http-server`](https://npmjs.com/http-server).

Note: this datavisualization doesn't play nicely with Safari, due to it's strict anti autoplay policies.
