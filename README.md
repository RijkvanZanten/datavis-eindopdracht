# Data Visualisation

My visualisation of my keystrokes of the past two weeks or so.

Uses D3 and the web audio api for the visualisations. Uses ES6 classes and RequireJS for easier code management.

Expects a bg.mp3 file in the mp3 directory for the ambient music. The file I used is a whopping 141MB, so I won't upload it to GitHub
